Simple. Fast. 259 languages. Mobile-friendly. Rock-solid (GeSHi).

== Description ==

**• Highlights:**

* Supports [259 languages](https://github.com/GeSHi/geshi-1.0/tree/v1.0.9.1/src/geshi).
* Server-side. Saves bandwidth, latency, and battery compared to client-side rendering.
* Near-zero load on the backend. With a caching solution this does not affect your page load time at all.
* Default style was tested with more than 20 themes, including Twenty Ten to Fifteen, and tweaked based on a bunch of user feedback.
* If you'd like to tweak the style: just provide your own CSS file. Styles are highly & easily configurable.
* Per-block styles: each code block on a single page can be styled on its own (if that is something you would liked to do).
* Clean, small and valid HTML output.
* Well-documented source code using modern WordPress API calls.
* Based on [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/), a reliable and well-established PHP highlighting engine, used by popular community forum applications such as phpBB or wiki applications such as Dokuwiki or MediaWiki.
* Forked from [WP-GeSHi-Highlight](https://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight/)

**• Usage:**

Recommendation: Write in Markdown using the "Text" (raw) editor. Do not use the "Visual" editor. Do not use Gutenberg. 

For example:

````
```php
$a  = $b + 2;
```
````

That will render as the HTML:

`<pre><code class="language-php">
$a = 1;
</code></pre>`

Which will then be syntax highlighted.

Publish/preview, and have a look at the result!
