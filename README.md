# WP-GeSHi-Highlight-Redux

This is a personal fork of the venerable [WP-GeSHi-Highlight](https://gehrcke.de/wp-geshi-highlight/) - a WordPress plugin which converts `<pre>` elements into server-side rendered highlighted code.

You can [download the original WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-geshi-highlight/) which was developed by [Dr. Jan-Philip Gehrcke](https://gehrcke.de/).

This fork contains some bugfixes, changes, and improvements by [Terence Eden](https://edent.tel).

## Changelog

### 1.5.0
* RSS & Atom feeds - disable code highlighting
